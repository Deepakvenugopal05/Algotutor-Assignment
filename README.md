# LeetCode Solutions for Specific Topics

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository, where I share my solutions to various LeetCode problems focusing on specific topics. As I work through different problem categories on LeetCode, I'll be regularly updating this repository with new solutions, optimizations, and explanations.

## Table of Contents

- [Arrays and Strings]: Solutions for problems related to 2D-arrays and strings.

## Project Structure

Each topic has its own folder, containing the solutions to the corresponding problems. I have organized the code in a modular and readable manner, making it easy for anyone to understand and learn from.

## Language and Environment

I primarily use Python for writing my solutions, and I recommend using Python 3.7 or higher to run the code successfully.

## Explanation of Solutions

For each problem, I provide a brief explanation of the approach used to solve it. This will help you understand the thought process behind the solution and the reasoning behind the algorithm and data structures used.

## LeetCode Problem Links

To ensure clarity and to keep the context of each solution intact, I include filename to the corresponding LeetCode problems for reference.


## Contributing

I encourage contributions from the community. If you have alternative solutions, improvements, or new problems to add, feel free to submit a pull request. Let's learn together and make this repository a valuable resource for everyone.
